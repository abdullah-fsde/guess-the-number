# guess-the-number
A fun Python guessing game with scoring system and file logging
# ðŸŽ¯ Guess The Number â€“ Python Game Project

This is a fun and interactive game built using Python, where the computer thinks of a number between 1 to 10 and the user has to guess it. The number isn't revealed, and the game continues until the correct guess is made.

It also keeps track of the *number of attempts* and saves the *best score* in a file â€” encouraging users to beat their previous record! ðŸ§ ðŸ’¡
